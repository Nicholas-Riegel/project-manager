# project-manager

At a later date I would like to come back to this project and add some functionalities - like making saved fields editable, but right now I feel like I've spent a lot of time on it, and I would like to return to progressing through TOP's modules.

I would also like to credit flatpickr @https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr for the date picker I used. I think it is a really great date picker, and it was pretty easy to install and get working. 

I would also like to credit Kyle at Web Dev Simplified @https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7FaYfuwu70. I watched this video in order to understand how to use local storage (a subject not covered by TOP). I only watched the first half of this video, because that was enough to understand how to use local storage.
